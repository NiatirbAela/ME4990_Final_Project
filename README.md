# ME4990_Final_Project
# Machine Learning Project - Recognizing JPG Numbers

#------------------------PROCCESS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Train a model to recognize hand written numbers. 
# How?
#   Data sets:
#        Use training set for training, use example testing set for evaluation
#        Augment data for a larger training set → more accurate training

#   Use at least 3 networks (one can be from an online source, but cannot be loaded directly - no copy/paste)
#        Show Network structure(layers/functions), and understanding of dimension in each layer
#            EX: Conv(5×5) → ReLU → MaxPool → Conv(5×5) → ReLU → FC → Softmax

#   Find models with the highest accuracy
#        Trained versions of the network (explain weights, bias, learning rate , epochs, optimizers, and loss progress, MSE)
#        Should be saved under a specific file name to use trained model during demo

#   GUI:
#        Display uploaded JPG, and present prediction
#        Have a method to select which one of the 3 trained methods (models) to use for prediction
#        Other information like histogram of probability, accuracy, and confusion matrix from test set
#        Make It Pretty!!

#-----------------------DELIVERABLES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Progress Report:
#        Use presentation slide (so you can re-use for presentation and report)
#           Show your GUI is working
#           Show your proposed networks you are going to implement
#           Any other items available

#  Demonstration:
#        The instructor will provide you 10 images with the same size in jpg, recognize these 10 images one by one

#  Report: 
#        Intro(Research) → Method/Approach(Data, Network structure/dimensions) → Implementation (Structure of code,          #                  Criterion & optimization methods, # of epochs/batch size, progress of loss with epochs) →                 #                              Result (Testing accuracy & confusion matrix, Analysis) → Conclusion
